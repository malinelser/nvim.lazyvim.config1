# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

Not quite understood the difference between the undo tree plugin and the undo history plugin included in snacks.nvim, and also unclear why it wasn't there until I pasted in all the code from the README on snacks github page into snacks.lua
Anyhow, now I have commented out all code from undotree.lua, meaning disabled the undo tree plugin.
